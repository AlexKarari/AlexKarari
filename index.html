    <h2><Strong>About me...</strong></h2>
      <img src="images/alex1.jpg" alt="A photo of the web designer">
      <p>I was born not long ago in the rural villages in Kenya and graduated soon after with a first class honours from Strathmore university,
         Nairobi, having pursued a degree on Bachelors of Business Information Technology.</p>
        <p>I've worked for a ministry in the Kenyan Government and soon after left and started working for a music entertainment industry that is
        redifining music content delivery and live shows in Kenya and the region around.</p>
        <p>I enjoy developing websites and deliver world class quality to my clients as i mostly do freelance web designing. The smile that
          comes from clients from my finished product motivates me to develop even better and elegeant sites.</p>
          <p>Why programming for me? This will equip me with lifeskills that i can use to create job opportunities later on in future in addition to
            being able to mentor other young developers out there.</p>
          <p>I look forward to workinng for bluechip companies in Nairobi and the world. That not withstanding, <span class="dream">I long to work with well reknowned
        world class developers like myself to redefine web and app designing in the planet!</span></p>
