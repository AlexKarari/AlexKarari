      <p>Hujambo! Alexander Karari here! Looking for the most simplistic yet elegant web designed for you? look no further. I design and build corporate websites, web applications, landing pages; both back and front end designs.</p>
    <h2><Strong>About me...</strong></h2>
      <p>I was born not long ago in the rural villages in Kenya and graduated soon after with a first class honours from Strathmore university, Nairobi, having pursued a degree on Bachelors of Business Information Technology.
        I've worked for a ministry in the Kenyan Government and soon after left and started working for a music entertainment industry that is redifining music content delivery and live shows in Kenya and the region around.
        I enjoy developing websites and deliver world class quality to my clients as i mostly do freelance web designing. The smile that comes from clients from my finished product motivates me to develop even better and elegeant sites.
        I look forward to workinng for bluechip companies in Nairobi and the world. That not withstanding, I long to work with well reknowed world class developers like myself to redefine web and app designing in the planet!</p>
